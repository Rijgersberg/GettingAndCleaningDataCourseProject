GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
===================================

This repo contains the submission for the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course (getdata-007) on Coursera. 
The purpose of the Course Project is "to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis."

Original Dataset
----------------
The original dataset is the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
It contains the results of experiments with 30 volunteers who performed 6 activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist.
The smartphone collected 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity data, which was used to calculate a vector of features.
For full details on the original dataset, we refer to the above link.

Contents
-----------------
- The script ``run_analysis.R`` contains all the steps necessary to download and import the raw data, and to transform it into a tidy dataset.
The script requires the ``util`` and ``plyr`` R packages to be installed.
- The Markdown file ``CodeBook.md`` contains the Code Book: a document explaining the variables, the data and the transformations that are performed to clean up the data.
- The file ``UCI_HAR_tidy.txt`` contains the tidy dataset, which can be regenerated by running ``run_analysis.R``.
